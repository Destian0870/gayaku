# A detector finds the garments, the classifier names each one

**Status**: accepted — supersedes ADR-0005, which assumed one garment per photo. ADR-0001 (on-device inference), ADR-0003 (training data) and ADR-0006 (YOLOv8, AGPL-3.0) stand.

ADR-0005 opened with "the scanner accepts a single flat-lay or hanger photo, so it runs no object detector". That assumption is wrong for the product: a normal photo can hold a shirt, trousers and shoes at once, and the owner's reason for choosing YOLO was to handle exactly that. With today's pipeline a photo with two garments produces **one** item: the matting model merges the two silhouettes into a single cutout and the classifier answers one label for the pair. What ADR-0005 recorded as a scope line is a defect once the photo contains more than one item.

## Decision

Two models, two jobs, and neither one absorbs the other's:

1. **A YOLOv8 detector finds boxes.** It answers *where* and a coarse **Category** — one of the five from `CONTEXT.md` (Tops, Bottoms, Outerwear, Shoes, Accessories), which is exactly the vocabulary `labels.json` already uses. It does not predict the fine class.
2. **The 18-class classifier names the crop inside each box** — the model measured at 81.55 % top-1 on the merged test split (`docs/adr/0008`) is reused unchanged as this stage.
3. **Per box, the existing steps follow**: crop the photo to the box with a margin, matte the crop with `u2netp`, read the Dominant colour from that cutout. The order becomes detect → crop → matte + classify + colour, instead of matte → classify on a single cutout.

The coarse Category is what keeps the detector cheap. Naming a box `Polo` requires box annotations for all 18 classes, and no public dataset has them; naming it `Tops` is what Fashionpedia, DeepFashion2 and ModaNet all already annotate, so the detector can be trained from whichever of them the licence allows — and several can be merged, the way `merge_datasets.py` merged the classification sources.

## Training data

`Fashionpedia` (Kaggle/HuggingFace mirrors of the ECCV 2020 release): 46,781 photographs, 342,182 bounding boxes, **annotations licensed CC BY 4.0**, images stay under the terms of the sites they came from (Flickr, Unsplash, Burst, Pexels, …). Its categories cover what the app needs, including `shoe`, `hat`, `bag, wallet`, `watch`, `glasses`, and the garments; its 19 *garment part* categories (`hood`, `collar`, `sleeve`, `pocket`, `zipper`, …) are **parts of an item, not items**, and a conversion must drop them or the detector learns to box sleeves.

The mapping onto the five Categories follows `labels.json`, not intuition — `sweater` and `cardigan` are Outerwear there, `dress` and `jumpsuit` are Tops, `vest` is Outerwear (Waistcoat). The conversion script writes the table it applied into its manifest, as `merge_datasets.py` does, so the detector's classes can be audited against the label table.

## Consequences

* **The scan produces a list, not an item.** `ScanResult` becomes several results; the review screen shows every detected garment with its own crop, label, confidence and colour; one photo can add several `WardrobeItem`s. This is a product change the owner has asked for, and it changes the UI contract, not just the model.
* **NMS and thresholds become product behaviour.** A jacket worn over a shirt is legitimately two boxes, so the overlap rule has to allow containment rather than suppressing one of the two. The Correction step is still what fixes a wrong split.
* **Detection accuracy and naming accuracy are reported separately**: mAP50 on the boxes, then the classifier's per-class recall on the crops. Neither number hides the other.
* **A second model in the APK.** `yolov8n` detection at 640 px is a few MB, which the ADR-0005 budget (u2netp 5–9 MB) has to absorb; the asset table in `ml_workspace/README.md` gains a row.
* **Training that stage on this CPU has not been measured.** Classification was 67 ms per photograph at 224 px; detection trains at 640 px over 46k images, and it will not be 2.3 hours. Measure before promising a date, and expect the GPU question (Kaggle, whose notebook already exists for the classifier) to return for this stage only.
* **Garments worn on a body stay hard.** The detector will find the box; matting a worn garment still cuts the wrong silhouette, which is what the `pleated_midi_skirt` sweep photograph shows. Detection does not fix that, and the Correction step remains the answer.
* **Licence posture**: Ultralytics-trained weights are AGPL-3.0 (ADR-0006); Fashionpedia's annotations are CC BY 4.0 and need attribution if the annotations are redistributed; its photographs keep their source terms. Weights and builds stay coursework artifacts (ADR-0003, ADR-0007).

## Considered options

* **Keep ADR-0005** (one garment per photo, no detector): the pipeline already works and the classifier is measured, but the product cannot accept a normal photo. Rejected by the owner: it contradicts why YOLO was chosen.
* **One detector with all 18 fine classes**: the app would need no second stage, but it needs box annotations for 18 classes that no public dataset has, and it would discard the classifier we just trained and measured.
* **A single-class "garment" detector**: avoids the Category mapping, but the app could not tell shoes from a jacket before classifying a crop, so matting and outfit matching would lose the signal they already have. The five slots cost almost nothing more.
* **ModaNet first**: 55k street photographs with polygons, but CC BY-NC 4.0 — non-commercial — and street scenes are the hardest case for matting.
* **DeepFashion2 first**: 491k images and 801k boxes, the most complete option, but access runs through a request form, and 491k images is far more than a first detector needs.

## Open

* Which dataset the first detector ships from (Fashionpedia proposed) and whether a second source is merged in.
* Whether that training runs on this CPU or on a GPU; measure the epoch first.
* The multi-item review UI, which is the owner's design decision, not a model one.
